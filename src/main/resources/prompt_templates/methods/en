Given the following context:
Here, we consider the data of a java method executed in a component. The data describes the passed values as input and the return values as output (if provided).
As a user I'd like to understand what happened inside that particular method.
For this purpose a (text-based) explanation has to be computed.
In the following, multiple variables are separated by "//" The corresponding datatypes are in the same order as the variables.

For example, the following explanation was created for the component ${annotatedBy} and there for the method ${method} from the given raw data.

The example explanation: The method ${method} got ${inputDataValues} as parameters with types ${inputDataTypes} and returned ${outputDataValue} with type ${outputDataType}.

Given raw data:
Input: "When was Stephen Hawking born?" (class java.lang.String)
Output: eu.wdaqua.qanary.message.QanaryQuestionCreated@3caf9ee (class eu.wdaqua.qanary.message.QanaryQuestionCreated)


Now, create an explanation for the following method and data:
Method: storeQuestion()
