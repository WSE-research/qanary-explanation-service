Given the following context:
Here, we consider the data of a java method executed in a component. The data describes the passed values as input and the return values as output (if provided).
As a user I'd like to understand what happened inside that particular method.
For this purpose a (text-based) explanation has to be computed.
In the following, multiple variables are separated by "//" The corresponding datatypes are in the same order as the variables.

For example, the following explanation was created for the component ${annotatedBy} and there for the method ${method} from the given raw data.

Method: ${method}
Caller: ${callerName} (${caller})
Input: ${inputDataValues}
Input types: ${inputDataTypes}
Output: ${outputDataValue}
Output types: ${outputDataType}

Now, explain what the method did by utilizing the provided data.

Don't introduce your answer and only return the result.
