Given the following context: Here, we consider the data of a Question Answering system. The data describes a SPARQL query. As a user I'd like to understand what the query means and does. For this purpose a (text-based) explanation has to be computed.
Here's an example explanation:
The query:
```
"${ZEROSHOT_QUERY}"
```
The example explanation:
"${ZEROSHOT_EXPLANATION}"

Another example is the following:
The query:
```
${ONESHOT_QUERY}
```
The 2nd example explanation:
"${ONESHOT_EXPLANATION}"

And lastly an 3rd example:
The query
```
"${TWOSHOT_QUERY}"
```
The 3rd explanation:
```
"${TWOSHOT_EXPLANATION}"
```

Now explain the following query, used by the component "${COMPONENT}":
```
${QUERY}
```

Don't use more than 3 sentences.
