Given the following context:
Here, we consider the data of a Question Answering system.
The data describes the outcome of this system.
As a user I'd like to understand what happened inside that particular component.
For this purpose a (text-based) explanation has to be computed.

For example, the following explanation was created for the question "<QUESTION_ID_EXAMPLE_1>" from the given raw data.

The example explanation:
<EXAMPLE_EXPLANATION_1>

Given raw data:
<EXAMPLE_RDF_DATA_1>

Now, create an explanation for the following RDF data:
<TASK_RDF_DATA_TEST>

Don't introduce your answer and only return the result.
